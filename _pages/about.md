Welcome! I'm **Mudit Bhargava**, an engineer with a deep interest in bridging the gap between hardware and software. My work spans signal processing, financial modeling, machine learning, and FPGA development—areas that constantly push me to think across disciplines.

## What I Work On

My projects typically involve:

- **Signal Processing** — Developing algorithms for real-time data analysis and embedded applications
- **Financial Modeling** — Building quantitative models and exploring algorithmic trading strategies
- **Machine Learning** — Designing neural networks and intelligent systems for practical problems
- **FPGA Development** — Creating high-performance hardware accelerators and embedded systems

## My Philosophy

I believe the most interesting problems live at the intersection of different fields. Combining rigorous signal processing with modern machine learning, then implementing it on custom hardware—that's where I find the work most rewarding. I enjoy taking ideas from theory all the way to working implementations.

## Current Interests

Right now, I'm focused on:

- Hardware acceleration of AI algorithms on FPGAs
- Real-time signal processing for financial applications
- Contributing to open-source projects in the FPGA and signal processing space
- Exploring the practical applications of ML in embedded systems

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to conversations about interesting technical challenges. If you're working on something in signal processing, need help with FPGA implementations, or want to discuss ML applications in finance, I'd be happy to connect.
