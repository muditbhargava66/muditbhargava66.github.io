Welcome! I'm **Mudit Bhargava**, a passionate engineer specializing in signal processing, financial modeling, machine learning/AI, and FPGA development. I combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to build innovative solutions at the intersection of hardware and software.

## 🚀 What I Do

I work on cutting-edge projects that leverage:

- **Signal Processing**: Advanced algorithms for real-time data analysis and processing
- **Financial Modeling**: Quantitative analysis and algorithmic trading strategies
- **Machine Learning/AI**: Deep learning models and intelligent systems
- **FPGA Development**: High-performance hardware acceleration and embedded systems

## 💡 My Approach

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary thinking. By combining signal processing techniques with modern AI/ML approaches and implementing them on high-performance hardware like FPGAs, I create solutions that are both innovative and practical. My work spans from theoretical algorithm development to hands-on hardware implementation.

## 🎯 Current Focus

I'm currently exploring:

- Real-time signal processing on FPGAs for financial applications
- Machine learning models for predictive analytics in trading systems
- Hardware acceleration of AI algorithms
- Open-source contributions to the signal processing and FPGA communities
