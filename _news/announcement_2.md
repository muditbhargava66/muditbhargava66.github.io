I'm thrilled to announce my latest project focusing on implementing machine learning algorithms on FPGAs for ultra-low latency applications in financial markets.

---

## Project Overview

In the world of high-frequency trading and financial modeling, every microsecond counts. Traditional CPU-based implementations of machine learning models often fall short when it comes to meeting the stringent latency requirements of modern financial systems.

### Key Features:

- **Ultra-low latency**: Sub-microsecond inference times
- **High throughput**: Processing millions of data points per second
- **Energy efficient**: 10x better performance per watt compared to GPUs
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy to deploy across multiple FPGAs

### Technical Stack:

- **Hardware**: Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs
- **Development**: Vivado HLS for high-level synthesis
- **ML Framework**: Custom lightweight inference engine
- **Interface**: PCIe Gen4 for high-speed data transfer

## Applications

This project has immediate applications in:

1. **Real-time market data analysis**
2. **Algorithmic trading systems**
3. **Risk assessment and portfolio optimization**
4. **Anomaly detection in financial transactions**

## Open Source Contribution

I believe in the power of open-source collaboration. The entire codebase, including:

- HDL implementations
- HLS C++ code
- Python interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation

will be available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/muditbhargava66) soon!

Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have questions about the project.
